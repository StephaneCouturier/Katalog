- [**Explore**](https://github.com/StephaneCouturier/Katalog/wiki/Explore) the contents of the catalogs while devices are disconnected,
- Organize your collection of [**Catalogs**](https://github.com/StephaneCouturier/Katalog/wiki/Catalogs) and [**Storage**](https://github.com/StephaneCouturier/Katalog/wiki/Storage) devices, and get [**Statistics**](https://github.com/StephaneCouturier/Katalog/wiki/Statistics),

### How to install or run

- Linux: download the linux tar to use a portable version, running the file Katalog.sh
- Windows: download and run the win64 installer which will create a menu entry, or download the win64 zip to use a portable version, running the file Katalog.exe

### First use / tips

- Simply start with the [**Create**](https://github.com/StephaneCouturier/Katalog/wiki/Create) screen. Create your first catalog and experiment!
- All data are stored in several files stored in the [Collection folder](https://github.com/StephaneCouturier/Katalog/wiki/Settings#collection-folder). There is not one file containing everything. Instead, having multiple files grants flexibility to manage one or several collection. Each catalog of files is a different file, all statistics are stored in one file, all storage devices are stored in one file too.
