### Katalog is an application to manage storage devices and catalogs of files to search and get statistics

- [**Search**](https://stephanecouturier.github.io/Katalog/docs/Features/Search) files even when the devices are disconnected, and find duplicates or differences
- [**Explore**](https://stephanecouturier.github.io/Katalog/docs/Features/Explore) the contents of the catalogs while devices are disconnected,
- Organize your collection of [**Catalogs**](https://stephanecouturier.github.io/Katalog/docs/Features/DevicesCatalogs) and [**Storage**](https://stephanecouturier.github.io/Katalog/docs/Features/DevicesStorage) devices, and get [**Statistics**](https://stephanecouturier.github.io/Katalog/docs/Features/Statistics),

### How to install or run

- Linux: download the linux tar to use a portable version, running the file Katalog.sh
- Windows: download and run the win64 installer which will create a menu entry, or download the win64 zip to use a portable version, running the file Katalog.exe

### First use / tips

- Simply start with the [**Create**](https://stephanecouturier.github.io/Katalog/docs/Features/Create) screen. Create your first catalog and experiment!
- All data are stored in several files stored in the [Collection folder](https://stephanecouturier.github.io/Katalog/docs/Features/Settings#collection). There is not one file containing everything. Instead, having multiple files grants flexibility to manage one or several collection. Each catalog of files is a different file, all statistics are stored in one file, all storage devices are stored in one file too.
