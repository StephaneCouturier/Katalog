It provides flexibility to create and a global **hierarchy of Devices** for improvements in Search or Statistics capabilities\\n\\n- **Data** can be managed now in a **database file** (SQLite format), keeping the option to stay with traditional csv files. This will enable also a future option to host the database on a server.\\n\\nThese changes involved major updates of the data model and data management.<br/>\\nTherefore the version comes with support for a 1.x > 2.0 migration procedure.\\n\\n&#9888; **Backup up your Katalog collection data made with previous versions before**. &#9888;\\n\\nTo know more about these main changes, explore the pages *Devices* and *Settings* from the Documentation.\\n\\nAny feedback via Facebook, Github, email are always appreciated \ud83d\ude09"}]}}')}}]);
